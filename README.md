Interface for computational tools in genetics
The most well-known application of bioinformatics is sequence analysis.
In sequence analysis, DNA sequences of various diseases are stored in databases for easy retrieval and comparison. 
When we know a particular sequence is a cause for a disease, the trace of the sequence in the DNA,
and the number of occurrences of the sequence defines the intensity of the disease.
This interface has tools that solve computational problems reated to genetic concepts like punnets square, calculating frequency of
particular nucleotide sequence in long dna/rna strands,longest common nucleotide sequence in two strands.
