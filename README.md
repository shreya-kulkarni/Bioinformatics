Interface for computational tools in genetics

The most well-known application of bioinformatics is sequence analysis.
In sequence analysis, DNA sequences of various diseases are stored in databases for easy retrieval and comparison. 
When we know a particular sequence is a cause for a disease, the trace of the sequence in the DNA,
and the number of occurrences of the sequence defines the intensity of the disease.

This interface has tools that solve computational problems related to genetic concepts like punnets square, calculating the frequency of particular nucleotide sequences in long DNA/RNA strands, the longest common nucleotide sequence in two strands,global alignment of dna sequences.

Algorithms used: Frequency of nucleotide sequence- KMP (Knuth–Morris–Pratt) string searching algorithm
Global alignment- Dynamic Programming and Backtracking in Needleman–Wunsch algorithm.
